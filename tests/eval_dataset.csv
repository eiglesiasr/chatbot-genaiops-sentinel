question,answer
What is Sentinel-1 mission?," Sentinel-1 is a mission under the Copernicus program, which is a joint initiative of the European Commission (EC) and the European Space Agency (ESA). It features a constellation of two sun-synchronous polar-orbiting satellites. These satellites perform C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging day and night, regardless of weather conditions."
Which are the main features of S-1?,"Imaging Modes: Operates in four exclusive imaging modes with varying resolutions (as fine as 5 meters) and coverage (up to 400 kilometers).
Dual Polarisation: Offers capabilities for enhanced data capture.
Revisit Time: Provides rapid revisit intervals with a 6-day exact repeat cycle for the constellation.
Data Accessibility: Ensures rapid product delivery and precise measurements of spacecraft position and attitude."
What type of aquisition mode does Senstinel-1 have?,"The Sentinel-1 SAR can be operated in one of four nominal acquisition modes:
1. Stripmap Mode (SM)
2. Interferometric Wide Swath Mode (IW)
3. Extra Wide Swath Mode (EW)
4. Wave Mode (WV)"
What is the main instrument carried by the spacecraft?,The Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) instrument is the main instrument carried by the Sentinel-1 spacecraft wich operates in the C-Band with horizontal and vertical polarisations. 
Which are the main system parameters of the plataform and SAR instrument? ,"Here are the main system parameters of the platform and SAR instrument:
Radar frequency: 5.405 GHz
Incidence Angle Range: 20° - 40°
Look direction: Right
Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF) Range: 1000 Hz - 3000 Hz
Polarisation Options: Single (HH, VV), Dual (HH+HV, VV+VH)
For more detailed information, you can access the document ""Sentinel-1 Product Definition"", Table 3-1"
What are the SAR instrument polarization capabilities?,"The Sentinel-1 instrument is able to transmit horizontal (H) or vertical (V) linear polarisations and receive on two separate receiving channels, both H and V signals simultaneously.
Tis ables two types of products: Single co-polarisation, obtained by operating the radar with the same (H or V) polarisation on both transmit and receive. And Dual-polarisation, obtained by operating the radar with one (H or V) polarisation on transmit and both simultaneously on receive.
For the SM, IW and EW modes, data can be acquired in either single co-polarisation (HH or VV) or dual polarisation (HH+HV or VV+VH). For WV mode, only single co-polarisation data acquisition is supported (HH or VV only)."
How is organized the product family of Sentinel-1?,"The Sentinel-1 product family is organized into different levels of processing, depending on the acquisition mode, each providing specific types of data for varied applications. Here's a breakdown of the Sentinel-1 product family:

Product Levels
Level-0 Products:
These are raw data products, which include the unprocessed instrument source packets. They serve as the foundational data for generating higher-level products. 
Level-1 Products:
When proccessing a L0 segment of data, the following types of L1 products are defined:
Single Look Complex (SLC): Provides complex measurements in GeoTIFF format per swath and polarization. It is mainly used for applications that require detailed analysis, such as interferometry.
Ground Range Detected (GRD): Includes detected measurements in GeoTIFF format per polarization. These are used for general applications requiring easier data handling and use, like land monitoring.
Level-2 Products:
Composed of one type of product: OCeaN (OCN). Contains geocoded data products in a netCDF format, which facilitates ease of use and integration into various analysis tools.
The detected products can be further classified according to their resolution into:
• Full Resolution (FR) products
• High Resolution (HR) products
• Medium Resolution (MR) products"
What are the component types of the OCN for Level-2 propducts?,"The Sentinel-1 Level-2 Ocean (OCN) products are designed to provide information for oceanographic applications. These products are organized as:

Ocean Wind Field (OWI): Provides gridded wind fields over the ocean surface. Used to better understanding wind patterns and their effects on ocean dynamics.
Ocean Swell (OSW): Contains data related to ocean swell, which is the long-wavelength surface gravity waves generated by distant weather systems. This information is important for maritime navigation and coastal management.
Radial Surface Velocity (RVL): Offers measurements of the ocean surface radial velocity, aiding in the study of ocean currents and their interactions with other climatic elements."
What kind of auxiliary data is used for Level-1 processing?,"For Level-1 processing of Sentinel-1 data, several types of auxiliary data are nedded which is not included in the data acquired from the satellite.
The auxiliary data for Sentinel-1 L1 product processing can be grouped into the following categories:
• Digital Elevation Model
• L1 Processor Parameters
• Calibration Data
• Instrument Parameters
• Orbit and Attitude Information "
What kind of auxiliary data is used for Level-2 processing?,"In order to generate Sentinel-1 L2 products, several types of auxiliary data are nedded which is not included in the data acquired from the satellite.
The auxiliary data for Sentinel-1 L2 product processing can be grouped into the following categories:
• ECMWF atmospheric model
• Simulated cross spectra data
• Sea ice data
• Wavewatch3 Stokes drift
• Excitation Coefficients Error Matrix
• L2 Processor parameters"
What's the current status of sentinel-1 mission?,"The spacecraft is stable, Sentinel-1A mission operations proceeded nominally, being monitored by the e Flight Operations Segment (FOS).
S-1A Data Quality is nominal and is being checked routinely by the S-1 Mission Performance Center, altough on 11th and 12th of February the time availability of NRT-3h
products was slightly degraded, which was notified. 
Specific planning requests were placed to support disasters and emergencys related to the tropical cyclone monitoring. Sentinel-1A was used to support major mainly related to floods and hurricanes."
